# Elements of Computer Vision


## Computer architecture of robots and the perception loop
- planning and action
- Perception, sensors and uncertainty
- Uncertain knowledge representation and knowledge representation networks
- Probabilistic robotics and Kalman filter
- Location and mapping
- Propositional logic, 1st-order predicate logic and planners
- Deliberative architectures
- Reactive cognitive architectures, behavioral robotics, subsumption model
- Hybrid Cognitive Architectures
- Image processing, sampling, highlighting, filtering and segmentation
- Notions of computer vision and pattern recognition
   - obtaining high cognitive level information from images
   - contours and classifiers based on position and feature vectors
- Commercial application of robots and emerging uses, robotic platform solutions and software for robots (R.O.S, OpenCV)
